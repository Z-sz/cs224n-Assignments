1. In utils.py StringIO is gone in python3. 
   Replace line 14 with 'from io import StringIO'

By the way, in this assignment I have a problem about the input that is
what dose 'n_word_features' variable in both rnn and window model represent?
Since L is a V by D matrix and V is the vocabulary size, dose it means that
each word in a sentence is represented by 'n_word_features' words, if so
how dose these representation generated?
