# cs224n-Assignments
My implementations of stanford CS224n: Natural Language Processing with Deep Learning(winter 2017) assignments.

Here are some solutins to those problems that I met when executing codes provided by the assignments:
* In assignment 1, link to download the glove dataset provided by file get_datasets.sh no longer exisits, you can go to http://www-nlp.stanford.edu/data/glove.6B.zip and download the dataset manually.
* In assignment 2 q2_parser_model.py :cPickle is replaced by _pickle in python3. I replaced 'Import cPickle' with 'import _pickle as cPickle'.
